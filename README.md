composable
==========

preview at a composable ECMAScript 3 compatible system - rather a proof of concept that
code duplication within a modular system almost can be prevented with Trait/Mixin based
object composition.

"modification.ao" is a fully aspect oriented javascript system that supports advanced
method modification/modifying or function composition.

So far there is no build/test automation at all. Tests will be provided step by step
from now on / 2013-10-01 - automated processes might follow as well.
